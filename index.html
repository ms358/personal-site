		<h2>About me</h2>
		<p> I'm Melvin. Data analyst by trade, and aspiring data scientist. Here's my <a
				href="assets/Melvin_Shajee_Resume.pdf">resume</a>.</p>
		<p> In case you're wondering about the plain-jane website, I was inspired by <a
				href=https://jeffhuang.com/designed_to_last />Jeff Huang's This Page is Designed to
			Last:A Manifesto for Preserving Content on the Web</a>
			to create a personal website that attempts to stick to vanilla HTML and CSS as much as possible,
			in the hopes of making something that will last well into the future. </p>
		<p> I graduated from New Jersey Institute of Technology in May 2025 with a B.S. in Biomedical
			Engineering. I was originally in a 5 year program and would have gotten an M.S in BME in May of
			2026, but I grew to love the analytics side, so instead I moved over to Rutgers Business School,
			where I'm pursuing a Master's in Information Technology and Analytics.</p>
		<h2>Projects I've worked on</h2>
		<p> <a href="https://github.com/ms358/MoVES-MLUI-Mirror">MoVES-MLUI</a>, or as my capstone team and I
			took to calling it, the OMAPP. Below is a brief video that my team made to explain how the
			hardware and software of the project works.</p>
