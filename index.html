		<p> Hi, I'm Melvin. Data analyst by trade, and aspiring data scientist. </p>
		<p> I was inspired by <a href=https://jeffhuang.com/designed_to_last />Jeff Huang's Designed to Last</a>
			to create a personal website that attempts to stick to vanilla HTML and CSS as much as possible,
			in the hopes of making something that will last well into the future. </p>
