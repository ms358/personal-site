		<h2>About me</h2>
		<p> I'm Melvin. Data analyst by trade, and aspiring data scientist/data engineer/software engineer/IT
			guy. Here's my <a href="assets/Melvin_Shajee_Resume.pdf">resume</a>.</p>
		<p> I graduated from New Jersey Institute of Technology in May 2025 with a B.S. in Biomedical
			Engineering. I was originally in a 5 year program and would have gotten an M.S in BME in May of
			2026, but I grew to love the analytics side, so instead I moved over to Rutgers Business School,
			where I'm pursuing a Master's in Information Technology and Analytics.</p>
		<h2>Projects I've worked on</h2>
		<p> <a href="https://github.com/ms358/MoVES-MLUI-Mirror">MoVES-MLUI</a>, or as my capstone team and I
			took to calling it, the OMAPP. Below is a brief video that my team made to explain the operation
			of the hardware and software of the project. There's also a <a
				href="assets/Capstone II Group 9 - Final Presentation.pptx">slideshow</a> if
			you want to take a look.</p>

		<p> Here is a picture of my home server where I run all my homelab stuff. You're looking at an Intel
			Core 2 Duo E7400, nVIDIA 9400 GT (512 MB), and <b>8 GB of DDR2 RAM</b> (enough for a house these
			days). </p>
		<img src="assets/Server OLD.jpg" alt="Picture of my home server" />
		<p> It was more than due for an upgrade, so I snagged a used Radeon Pro W5500 (8 GB) off eBay for around
			$70 shipped all the way from Las Vegas. </p>
		<img src="assets/Radeon Pro W5500.jpg" alt="Picture of my new Radeon Pro W5500" />
		<p> Here's a picture of the upgraded server with the new GPU installed. </p>

			alt="Picture of my home server with new GPU installed" />
		<p> Unfortunately, the W5500 wasn't outputting any video when I plugged it in. I guess the issue is the
			motherboard being too old (circa 2008) to support a modern GPU. The PCIe slot was only 2.0 so it
			was a long shot anyway. I ended up shelving the W5500 for a while, but then I saw a beautiful
			deal on eBay and once again couldn't resist. </p>
		<img src="assets/Server NEW.jpg" alt="Picture of my new CPU/Motherboard/RAM combo" />
		<p> Here's the new setup! An Intel Core i5-9400, B360m Motherboard, and 8 GB of DDR4 RAM. The new
			motherboard did the trick, and now I've got a decently powerful GPU for my homelab. </p>

		<p> In case you're wondering about the plain-jane website, I was inspired by <a
				href=https://jeffhuang.com/designed_to_last />Jeff Huang's "This Page is Designed to
			Last: A Manifesto for Preserving Content on the Web"</a>
			to create a personal website that attempts to stick to vanilla HTML and CSS as much as possible,
			in the hopes of making something that will last well into the future (and hopefully not be a
			pain to maintain).</p>
